# ESE (Essential Mode Enhanced)
Essential Mode Enhanced is a *fork* of [ESX](https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended) which aims to be a drag and drop replacement for ESX but offer better performance and increased functionality.

## How to use
ESE docs are currently being written, if it wasn't already obvious, ESE isn't ready for production use.

## New Features
No new features have been added yet, our plan is to gradually improve the existing codebase before introducing anything new.

## Breaking Changes
Currently, ESE has no breaking changes with ESX.
